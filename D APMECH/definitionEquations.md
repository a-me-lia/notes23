How to take the derivative?
-------

>$x(t) = 6 \cdot t^8$

Multiply each coefficient by the power of the term, then take one degree from the power:

>$v(t) = 6 \cdot 8 \cdot t^{8-1} = 48t^7$

Position - Velocity - Acceleration
------
To get from position to velocity, we take the derivative of the positon function
We can also get from velocity to the equation for acceration by taking the derivative again, this time of the velocity graph

>$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = 7 \cdot 48 \cdot t^{7-1} = 336t^6$

Lets do that for our first example as well! ($v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 3 \cdot t^2 - 2 \cdot t + 1 $)

>$a(t) = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot t - 1 \cdot 2 \cdot t^0 = 6t - 2$
