displacement as area under the curve
------
given a velocity-time graph $v(t) = 6t$, if we take the derivate of that: 
> $\frac{dv}{dt} = 6 \cdot 1 \cdot t^0 = 6$
That gives us the slope of the velocity-time.

Since displacement = area bound by curve, we can find it with mathematical methods.
First, we can find the displayment of a linear velocity- time graph with simple triangle geometry.
For our example. the displacement would simply be: 

> $\frac{1}{2}(t_f - t_i)(v_f - v_i)$
(half times change in t (base), times change in v (height))

car example
--------
hypothetically, you're in a car but only know the speed.
assume the v(t) graph is parabolic, and we want to find the displacement of the car.

If we simple use rectangles and triangles to get the area, we will always have big error and it will be very tedious. With integral calculus, we can find the true area under the curve my using an analytical method that gives the summation of all infinitismally small slices in that graph.

> displacement = $\int  v(t)dt$
> x(t) = $\int  v(t)dt + x$ (To get absolute position value, add the initial position.)

Same goes for Velocity from Acceleration:
> $v(t) = \int  a(t)dt + v$


Back to the car example, let say the function for the velocity is given $v(t) = -t^2 + 8t$
Now we take the integral to get the total displacement over a period of t
Going term by term to integrate: 

To integrate, we add a power and divide:
> $x(t) = - (\frac{1}{3}) \cdot t^{2+1} + 8 \cdot (\frac{1}{2}) \cdot t^{1+1} + x$
> $= \frac{-1}{3}t^3 + 4t^2 + x$

Question 11:
>$a(t) = \frac{-1}{2}\frac{m}{s^3}t + 3\frac{m}{s^2}$
>$v(t) = \int  a(t)dt = \frac{-1}{2}\frac{m}{s^3}t^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3\frac{m}{s^2}t$

Note that the last term gets a magic t cause originally $3\frac{m}{s^2}$ actually has a ${t^0}$ (1)
Add a constant to fulfill the initial velocity:

>$v(t) = \frac{-1}{4}\frac{m}{s^3}t^2 + 3\frac{m}{s^2}t + 8\frac{m}{s}$

Now lets find the position, given that the initial position is -7.2m:
>$x(t) = \int  v(t) dx$
>$x(t) = \frac{-1}{4}\frac{m}{s^3}t^3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 3 \frac{m}{s^2} t^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 8\frac{m}{s}t + 7.2m$

>$ = \frac{-1}{12} \frac{m}{s^3}t^3 + \frac{3}{2}\frac{m}{s^2} t^2 + 8\frac{m}{s}t -7.2m$

equation sheet
------
not many of the constants are needed in the first page of the equation sheet
ignore the right column for E&M on the second page of the equation sheet
the equation sheet is very bad lmao

the last and first page both have some mathematical references.
