> "Henry Kissinger is one of the most desructive secretaries in the united states."

The vietname used the Ho Chi Minh trail extensively for their war effort, and the US bobed it. Sihanok, then King of Cambodia had wished to preserve neutrality, but the surprise bombing of cambodia changed the situation.

2.7m tonnes of the b52 planes' bombs were dropped, most from high altitude so there was no warning.
The bombing of cambodia by the states contributed to the khmer rouges' support, especiallly against americans.

> "It's Nixon and his secretary's fault"

THe first articles of impeachment against Nixon had to do with the secret bombings of Cambodia, not watergate.

A crucial mistake of nix0n's was "linking cambodia to vietnam". Since Sihanok is seeing that he is losing control of his country, he turns to china for support. The us is then believed to has concocted a coup against him, to replace another man in his position.
